###### Question-1
## ENRON SCANDAL DATASET
Tried focusing on following words during analysis:
Fraud,

Sunk.

There are high chances that these words would be used somewhere. Tried to find the number of appearances of these words group by date and group by name. plotting the appearances by date would give rise and fall pattern of such words used this would give the idea about the sentiments (sentiment analysis) prevailing at different point of time. Also, the group by names would give an idea about important personalities involved in this.

Also, tried to make three - four topic groups of words, like,

Topic1: Business Legalities words: enron, deal, agreement, contract
Topic2: Business group related: gas, power etc

These topics related grouped words are to be plotted date-wise to see a pattern this will give an idea about how and when different stages of discussion have prevailed.
